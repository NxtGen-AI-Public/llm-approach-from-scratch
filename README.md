## Introduction

This Jupyter notebook provides a comprehensive guide to building a Language Learning Model (LLM) from scratch. The primary goal is to help you understand the fundamentals of LLM development, from data preprocessing to model training and evaluation. Key topics covered include:

- Tokenization and vocabulary creation
- Data preprocessing for training
- Constructing the model architecture
- Training using neural networks and deep learning techniques
- Fine-tuning the model for better performance

By following this notebook, you will gain practical insights into building and experimenting with LLMs.

## Installation

To set up the project and run the notebook, make sure you have the required dependencies installed.

### Installing via `requirements.txt`

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

or install via jupyter notebook
```
!pip install numpy pandas torch transformers jupyter
```

## Usage
To get started, follow these steps:

Clone the repository:
- git clone https://github.com/NxtGen-AI-Public/llm-approach-from-scratch.git
- Navigate to the project directory:
- cd llm-approach-from-scratch
- Open the Jupyter notebook: jupyter notebook "LLM from scratch.ipynb"
- Run the notebook cells step by step, following the instructions provided to train and evaluate the Language Learning Model.

## Usage

The notebook provides a structured approach to building an LLM:

1. Data Preprocessing:
    Tokenizing the input text and creating a vocabulary.
    Handling large datasets and preparing input sequences for training.
2. Model Architecture:
    Neural network layers, including embeddings, self-attention mechanisms, and feed-forward layers.
    Explanation of model hyperparameters such as learning rate, batch size, and optimizers.
3. Training:
    Training the model using PyTorch and Transformers.
    Applying gradient descent and backpropagation for optimization.
4. Evaluation:
    Using relevant metrics to measure the performance of the LLM.
    Fine-tuning the model based on results for improved accuracy.

## Results

The model's results, including performance metrics, accuracy, and loss curves, are displayed within the notebook. You will also be able to see how the model performs on various language tasks, such as text generation, translation, and other NLP tasks. But This is just a sample for understanding. Go ahead and train with Large corpus to get a real time feel of the LLM.
